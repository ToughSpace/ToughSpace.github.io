<p>After graduating from Iowa State University in 2008 with a degree in Computer Engineering, I worked as a software engineer for a small company in Des Moines before venturing off to start my own small consultancy in 2012.</p>
<p>Since then I've helped many companies maintain, develop, and support web-based software. With a focus on small/medium sized business level web applications, I help them operate more quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>My wife and I are currently living overseas, traveling the world, and enjoying life. We record a bi-weekly podcast about our adventures and transitions. You can read more about it on our website: <a tagret='_blank' href='http://funktravels.com'>FunkTravels.com</a>.</p>
